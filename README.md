# CSS-scale

#### A simple tool to scale PX and EM units of select properties. 

Input CSS code, select properties you want to scale, select a factor to scale to, and your code will be transformed.

This is useful if you have some code with a lot of absolute values that you want to play around with, and want to transform the 
actual values (instead of using `transform: scale()`.)

Currently, the following properties are supported: 

* `width`
* `height`
* `margin` (long-form & shorthand)
* `padding` (long-form & shorthand)
* `top`, `right`, `bottom`, `left`
* `font-size`
